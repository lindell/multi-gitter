Multi-gitter is a tool that allows you to run a script or program for every repository in a GitHub organisation that will then be committed and a PR will be created.

The script can be both a shell script or a binary. If the script returns with a 0 exit code and has made changes to the directory, a PR will be created.

## Usage
